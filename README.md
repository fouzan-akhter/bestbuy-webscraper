The webscraper for BestBuy is divided into two parts. Initially, a webdriver is utilized to extract the links of the products from a specified number of pages, determined by the max_pages variable. The second part involves inputting a link, from which Heading, Model Number, SKU Number, Rating, Reviews, and Price of each product are extracted. Both functions are separately defined. To achieve an autonomous process of webscraping, the function that extracts links should be connected to the function that extracts data from the links, and the final output is stored in a pandas dataframe.
